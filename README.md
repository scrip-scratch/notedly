Practice with the book "Javascript Everywhere" by Adam Scott

Right now on the chapter 15. Have resolved problem with new version of Appolo Client and InMemoryCash. Quit easy, by using the Appolo's queries. But I don't now how it will work in the next chapters.Could check web/src/components/Header.js
